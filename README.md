# Word-Guess-Game

This is Hangman game in which I implement key event to start a game and use keycode for users to pick letters to guess word for the game. If user select wrong letter it adds to the incorrect letters array and display to users which letter he/she guessed is wrong. 

In this user will have a 9 lives or guesses which will automatically decrease when user will guess wrong letter. And when user win or loss game the win counter or loss counter will increment respectively. After wining or losing the game the placeholders for next letter will appear immediately.
